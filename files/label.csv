What does that narrator think of Cathy?,Analyzing,,"The biggest thorn in the paw of my grand plan to stop going to school was that my mom would probably notice that I wasn't going to school.
It wasn't an issue, however. When I got home my mom was running around the house shuttling clothes from closets and drawers to open suitcases.
""Are we going somewhere?"" I asked, setting my car keys on the kitchen table.
She stopped in place and stood up, looking at me for a moment.
""I am,"" she started. ""I've been talking to Aunt Cathy on the phone and I don't think she's doing very well, with the divorce and then your father. I'm going to spend a few days out there with her until she's feeling better.""
Cathy is my dad's sister and I always suspected her to be a bit batty. She didn't come from Delaware for my dad's, her brother's, funeral; said she wouldn't be able to drive herself, and nobody could pick her up.
My mom continued, ""Would that be alright? I mean, will you be okay by yourself for a while?""
She must have noticed that I was handling things better than I had been at first. My dad died in January, it was now March. Seems like enough time to me.
""I'll be fine,"" I said. ""Nothing major going on, just school. Are you leaving tonight or tomorrow?""
Nothing major.
She left early the next morning, before I would normally leave for school. Before she left she told me not to throw any wild teenage drug parties. I told her I wouldn't know how if I wanted to. She left, I went back to bed.
It's a marvelous feeling, to sleep right through the start of the school day. Skipping school is one thing, playing sick is one thing, but just not going to school is another feeling entirely. It felt like freedom. The kind of freedom that will cost you later, but at the time seems worth it.","['That she is a little nuts.' 'not enough information'

Cathy is my dad's sister and I always suspected her to be a bit batty. She didn't come from Delaware for my dad's, her brother's, funeral; said she wouldn't be able to drive herself, and nobody could pick her up.
My mom continued, ""Would that be alright? I mean, will you be okay by yourself for a while?""
She must have noticed that I was handling things better than I had been at first. My dad died in January, it was now March. Seems like enough time to me.
""I'll be fine,"" I said. ""Nothing major going on, just school. Are you leaving tonight or tomorrow?""
Nothing major.
She left early the next morning, before I would normally leave for school. Before she left she told me not to throw any wild teenage drug parties. I told her I wouldn't know how if I wanted to. She left, I went back to bed.
It's a marvelous feeling, to sleep right through the start of the school day. Skipping school is one thing, playing sick is one thing, but just not going to school is another feeling entirely.

Why is it difficult to get the roof off the car?,Understanding,,"Two a.m. and we are standing on the side of the road waiting for the fire service to take the top off the car in front of us. The wind whistles across the flats making us all shiver despite our fleeces and our jackets.
Two cars have been involved in a high-speed road traffic accident (RTA), the parked car that was hit has been shunted forward leaving ten-yard-long skid marks. The cars aren't too damaged but the seats inside have shifted around, trapping the occupants.
There are seven ambulances here, four fire trucks, half a dozen police and three ambulance officers with clipboards. There are eight patients, all but one need cutting from the cars and collaring and boarding. The only woman involved is 'walking wounded'.
The reason that it is taking so long for our car to get its lid removed by the fire service is because of the position of one of the patients inside. He looks rather unwell and the crew looking after him really would like to get to him sooner rather than later.
Our ambulance was fourth on scene. When I arrived I spoke to a stationmate to see what he wanted us to do, who he wanted us to look after. Normally he is the station clown, now he's all serious and professional, no fake beards or silly glasses.

What time of day was the accident?,Understanding,,"Two a.m. and we are standing on the side of the road waiting for the fire service to take the top off the car in front of us. The wind whistles across the flats making us all shiver despite our fleeces and our jackets.
Two cars have been involved in a high-speed road traffic accident (RTA), the parked car that was hit has been shunted forward leaving ten-yard-long skid marks. The cars aren't too damaged but the seats inside have shifted around, trapping the occupants.
There are seven ambulances here, four fire trucks, half a dozen police and three ambulance officers with clipboards. There are eight patients, all but one need cutting from the cars and collaring and boarding. The only woman involved is 'walking wounded'.
The reason that it is taking so long for our car to get its lid removed by the fire service is because of the position of one of the patients inside. He looks rather unwell and the crew looking after him really would like to get to him sooner rather than later.
Our ambulance was fourth on scene. When I arrived I spoke to a stationmate to see what he wanted us to do, who he wanted us to look after. Normally he is the station clown, now he's all serious and professional, no fake beards or silly glasses.
Everyone gets checked over, all the ambulance crews are calm, it's serious but it doesn't look like anyone is about to die; more a case of being careful moving the patients 'just in case'.
The roof comes off the car and with the help of another crew and some firefighters we get our patient out safely and strapped to a board. He is freezing cold. He is not wearing warm clothing so the delay in getting him out and the terrible weather have us concerned for his body temperature.
We are in a new ambulance so the heater works. Turning it up to full we are soon sweating as we assess the patient and prepare for transport.","['In the late morning.' 'late at night' 'In the afternoon.'

How is the young man probably feeling?,Analyzing,,"The staffing of ambulances at the moment is ... to put it bluntly ... poor.
Working on the fast response unit (FRU - a car that is designed to get to the sickest patients quickly) means that I often get to an emergency call within minutes of it being made. Unfortunately, with so few ambulances on the road, the patient and I are often left staring at each other for long periods of time; in a couple of cases up to an hour.
I was sent to a young man having an asthma attack. It was late at night, and he had been queuing to get into a nightclub when he had started to feel his breathing getting tight, the sign of an asthma attack, so had headed to a taxi office in order to go home. Unfortunatel, his asthma progressed and so an ambulance was called. What he got was me, on my own, in a car.
After dealing with the drunken group of teenage girls that had taken time out of waiting for a cab to start loudly 'caring' for my patient, I started my assessment. It was a cold night so I sat the young man in the taxi office and listened to his chest. I could hear a nice loud wheezing from his lungs so I started him on the first dose of our asthma medication. I got his details and checked his vital signs, and waited for the ambulance to turn up.
It takes between five and ten minutes for the asthma medication to finish, and by the end of it there was still no ambulance.
I listened to his chest again, still an audible wheeze, so I gave him a second dose of the medication. So there he was, sitting in a cab office at three in the morning with a mask over his face, 'smoke' pouring from it, and all around us were intoxicated people getting cabs home.
