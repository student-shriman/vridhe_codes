"The biggest thorn in the paw of my grand plan to stop going to school was that my mom would probably notice that I wasn't going to school.
It wasn't an issue, however. When I got home my mom was running around the house shuttling clothes from closets and drawers to open suitcases.
""Are we going somewhere?"" I asked, setting my car keys on the kitchen table.
She stopped in place and stood up, looking at me for a moment.
""I am,"" she started. ""I've been talking to Aunt Cathy on the phone and I don't think she's doing very well, with the divorce and then your father. I'm going to spend a few days out there with her until she's feeling better.""
Cathy is my dad's sister and I always suspected her to be a bit batty. She didn't come from Delaware for my dad's, her brother's, funeral; said she wouldn't be able to drive herself, and nobody could pick her up.
My mom continued, ""Would that be alright? I mean, will you be okay by yourself for a while?""
She must have noticed that I was handling things better than I had been at first. My dad died in January, it was now March. Seems like enough time to me.
""I'll be fine,"" I said. ""Nothing major going on, just school. Are you leaving tonight or tomorrow?""
Nothing major.
She left early the next morning, before I would normally leave for school. Before she left she told me not to throw any wild teenage drug parties. I told her I wouldn't know how if I wanted to. She left, I went back to bed.
It's a marvelous feeling, to sleep right through the start of the school day. Skipping school is one thing, playing sick is one thing, but just not going to school is another feeling entirely. It felt like freedom. The kind of freedom that will cost you later, but at the time seems worth it.",What does that narrator think of Cathy?,"['That she is a little nuts.' 'not enough information'

Two cars have been involved in a high-speed road traffic accident (RTA), the parked car that was hit has been shunted forward leaving ten-yard-long skid marks. The cars aren't too damaged but the seats inside have shifted around, trapping the occupants.
There are seven ambulances here, four fire trucks, half a dozen police and three ambulance officers with clipboards. There are eight patients, all but one need cutting from the cars and collaring and boarding. The only woman involved is 'walking wounded'.
The reason that it is taking so long for our car to get its lid removed by the fire service is because of the position of one of the patients inside. He looks rather unwell and the crew looking after him really would like to get to him sooner rather than later.
Our ambulance was fourth on scene. When I arrived I spoke to a stationmate to see what he wanted us to do, who he wanted us to look after. Normally he is the station clown, now he's all serious and professional, no fake beards or silly glasses.
Everyone gets checked over, all the ambulance crews are calm, it's serious but it doesn't look like anyone is about to die; more a case of being careful moving the patients 'just in case'.
The roof comes off the car and with the help of another crew and some firefighters we get our patient out safely and strapped to a board. He is freezing cold. He is not wearing warm clothing so the delay in getting him out and the terrible weather have us concerned for his body temperature.

At the bottom of the stairs just sheltered from the rain was a young man in his twenties, dirty, dressed in filthy clothes and curled up next to a plastic bag. Standing over him was another man, this one dressed in a suit, looking a bit concerned.
(The London borough of Tower Hamlets has both the richest, and the poorest population in London.)
'He's just laying there, not talking,' the smartly dressed man said. 'I didn't really know what to do ...'
I let him know that I'd take care of the patient, and that he had done the right thing and could go home.
It was just me and the patient. Given the way he looked it was a reasonable assumption that he was homeless. If he was homeless then there was a reasonable assumption that he was drunk and given that he was in such a public place there was a chance that there was something physically wrong with him.
I attempted to wake him up - he was keeping his eyes closed when I tried to open them, so I knew that he wasn't really unconscious.
'Look mate,' I said, 'if you don't open your eyes, I'll have to check your blood sugar, which means poking a needle into your finger. If you open your eyes then I won't have to do that.'
No response.
So I checked his blood sugar along with the rest of his vital signs; everything was fine.
I crouched down opposite him. 'Look, you can open your eyes and talk to me you know - we'll still take you to hospital.

The parents and child spoke poor English, but we easily managed to learn that the child was suffering from an earache, and that this was the cause of the head-hitting. 'How long has he had the pain?' asked my crewmate for the night. 'Five years then, three hours now,' replied the father. We understood what he meant - the child had an earache five years ago, but this current episode, and the reason why we were called out, had lasted three hours. 'Have you given him any painkillers?'

We got the job as 'child banging head on walls and floor' and when we turned up the child was indeed clutching his head and hitting it against a wall. The parents and child spoke poor English, but we easily managed to learn that the child was suffering from an earache, and that this was the cause of the head-hitting. 'How long has he had the pain?' asked my crewmate for the night. 'Five years then, three hours now,' replied the father. We understood what he meant - the child had an earache five years ago, but this current episode, and the reason why we were called out, had lasted three hours. 'Have you given him any painkillers?' 'No,' the father looked confused. 'Do you have any painkillers?' my crewmate asked. 'Yes, but we haven't given him any,' said the father. So the family could see their child rolling around the floor, screaming in pain and banging his head against the walls, and didn't consider that a painkiller might have - oh, I don't know - helped with the pain. I can imagine the scene in the hospital when the nurses give the child some pain relief - the parents looking at each other, slapping their foreheads and saying, 'Doh! We could have done that!' There are a lot of daft people out there - and I get to meet most of them.",For how long has the narrator probably been helping sick people?,['weeks' 'not enough information' 'days' 'years'],3

First it was McCardle's Milk, which was cool because they had Pop Gums, a slime-green ice cream bar with bubble gum in the middle of it. Then it was Moishe's Meats, which pretty much put it off my map since when I was seven I was unlikely to want to browse in a butcher's store that had slabs of dead cows and featherless chickens in its window as if that would really draw people in. I think that'd be true even if I weren't a vegetarian. Then it was The Nickel House, which sold newspapers and comics and other things that cost a lot more than a nickel. They went out of business, maybe because you can't lie in your store's name and expect to get away with it for long. And then someone named Herb bought it and I guess gave up on trying to figure out what he would be selling, so it became the This 'n That Store, which was exactly what it was.

Second, having just finished working on math problems put me in the right frame of mind. I had just been busting my brain on those problems where you have to figure out what the next number is by catching on to the pattern in the numbers before it. For example, if the series were 1,3,7,15 the next number would be 31 because between 1 and 3 is 2, and between 3 and 7 is 4, and between 7 and 15 is 8, so you keep multiplying the difference by two and adding it. And that turns out to be the same thing as multiplying by two and adding one. How almost interesting! So, when the lottery ticket floated off of my violin and fluttered down to the floor, for the first time I saw the number that the hat lady had picked. 35-8-27-9-18-9. Now, normally I have a real hard time with these types of problems, but this one I got right away, even though there was no reason to think there was anything to get. Maybe that's why I got it. Or maybe it was just that I noticed that the digits of the first number - 35 - added up to the second number. And, then, while I was at it, I noticed that if you subtract the second number from the first one - 35 minus 8 - you get the third number.

"Jack Hardin stood with the wind blowing through his dark brown hair, his hands shoved deep into the pockets of his best black slacks. His head hung down, his gaze intent upon the marker of his father's grave. He had visited the spot enough to have memorized every detail, so though his eyes looked there, they looked nowhere. Jack stood there and tried to make sense of it all. He was sure, absolutely sure, that this was the hardest thing he would ever have to do. The morning was clear, apart from a few clouds huddling around the sun for warmth. There was a bird delivering a morning sermon from a tree overhanging the edge of the cemetery. On days when the wind was right, Jack could hear the choir singing from the First Baptist Church three blocks over. Today was not one of those days, however, so he could not. Even if the wind had been right, Jack would not have listened, for he paid no attention to anything around him. Cars passed the cemetery, heading north toward Highway 15 and out of town, unnoticed. He reserved his attention strictly for his father. All the various aspects of Sunday for Jack were summarized in that place. It was the only church he ever attended, the only one he felt he needed. Taking a moment away from his reverie, he noticed the grass. It had begun to encroach upon the bronze plaque with its raised letters declaring his father's presence. He bent and began pulling up the shoots. The few intruders were ripped up by Jack's slow, thoughtful hands.

"Jack worked all afternoon with the three lines of musical notation he had scribbled the day before, and was getting absolutely nowhere. Not necessarily nowhere, he corrected himself, those three lines have been perfected and re-perfected five times over. He had them memorized to the point where he could more than likely play them backwards. Have I eaten today? He looked at the clock on the wall. It was after five o'clock.

He'd sing along with the radio, he'd sing along with the television, hell, he'd make shit up and sing it if there wasn't anything else to sing. He wrote lyrics, good ones too, but his voice wasn't for shit. He was always either writing lyrics or poetry, or turning one into the other. He was quite a character. Next there was Jonathan, who was fourteen and well built for his age. He was one of those kids who got the hormone hit early and heavy and shot up and out and around and any other direction he could manage. He wanted to play football, and couldn't wait to get to high school so he could bash some heads.",What kind of programs does the narrator think are prevalent in the local college?,['football' 'not enough information' 'liberal arts' 'engineering'],3

We knew this town had really nothing to offer us, for one thing, and we had to get out as soon as possible or this hellhole would swallow us completely. We all wanted to do something with our lives that just didn't fit with the small town mentality. And I know, this isn't supposed to be the typical small town. I hear there's a couple of places called ""research parks"" now that have a lot of really great, fast-moving corporations that provide a lot of needed dollars, where you can go and get a job that will take you just as far as the company wants you to go. But go ahead and preach to me about how great this town is and how free-thinking and progressive and so forth and then trot over to the community college, and see how many liberal arts classes they offer.
